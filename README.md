# Interactive Chess Game

A web-based chess application that I developed to improve my understanding of game development and artificial intelligence. This project helped me learn about:
- Canvas-based game rendering
- Chess move validation and game mechanics
- AI opponent implementation using minimax algorithm
- Web application development with Flask

## Features I Implemented

1. **Interactive Chess Board**: 
   - Responsive game board using HTML5 Canvas
   - Drag-and-drop piece movement
   - Move validation based on chess rules

2. **AI Opponent**:
   - Multiple difficulty levels (Beginner to Legendary)
   - Position evaluation using piece-square tables
   - Advanced move pruning for better performance

3. **Training Features**:
   - Move suggestion helper
   - 20 chess puzzles for practice
   - Visual move indicators

4. **Customization**:
   - 8 different board themes
   - Smooth animations
   - Modern UI design

## Development Journey

This project started as a simple chess board implementation, but I gradually added more features as I learned:

1. First implemented basic board rendering and piece movement
2. Added chess rules and move validation
3. Implemented basic AI using minimax algorithm
4. Enhanced AI with alpha-beta pruning and position evaluation
5. Added puzzles and training features
6. Improved UI/UX with animations and themes

## Technical Implementation

- Frontend: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- Backend: Python Flask
- Chess Logic: chess.js library
- AI: Custom implementation of minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning

## Learning Outcomes

- Deep understanding of game tree algorithms
- Experience with canvas-based game development
- Practice with full-stack web development
- Insights into chess engine implementation

## Future Improvements

Planning to add:
- Multiplayer support
- More advanced AI strategies
- Additional puzzle levels
- Move analysis feature

## Setup and Running

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python dependencies
3. Run `python main.py`
4. Open browser at `http://localhost:5000`
